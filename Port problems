The port I use: /dev/ttyACM0
I set up my breadboard with the help of this link:
       https://www.makerspaces.com/simple-arduino-projects-beginners/
I connected the port to my laptop. While uploading the blink sketch, I get this error:
       avrdude: ser_open(): can't open device "/dev/ttyACM0": Permission denied
       An error occured while uploading the sketch
If I type the command: sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0 on terminal
and then try uploading,it gives the message "Done Uploading".
Now the LED Blinks at a slower rate.(Right output obtained).
My first Arduino experiment works!
